                <p>VSS was founded in 2023 with a simple mission: to make car rental more accessible, affordable, and sustainable for everyone. We recognized that many car owners have vehicles sitting idle for days or weeks, while others struggle to find affordable rental options.</p>
                <p>Our platform bridges this gap by connecting car owners with people who need a vehicle. This peer-to-peer model not only provides car owners with an opportunity to earn extra income but also gives renters access to a wider variety of cars at competitive prices.</p>
                <p>What started as a small operation in Mumbai has now expanded to over 100 cities across India, with thousands of cars listed and tens of thousands of happy customers.</p>
